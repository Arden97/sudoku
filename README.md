# sudoku
Small sudoku game written in C. This program was created as a semester project of the BPC-PC1T course at the VUT FEKT.

## How it works?

The program will prompt the player to start a new game or load a saved one. If a new game option was selected, the player will have to enter starting numbers on the game board. If a saved game option was selected, the player will need to specify the path to save file.

Save file examples can be found in the `tests` folder.
